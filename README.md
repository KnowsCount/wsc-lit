### ‚Åá Conclusion Questions

- It‚Äôs only a matter of time before Baby Yoda shows up amongst the roller coasters at Disney‚Äôs [Galaxy‚Äôs Edge](https://www.space.com/40842-star-wars-galaxy-edge-theme-park.html), while those who prefer wizards to Skywalkers can pop by Hagrid‚Äôs hut at Universal Studios‚Äô Wizarding World. Explore the emergence of immersive theme parks in which fans can interact with their favorite narratives. How different is Galaxy‚Äôs Edge from the motion simulator ride ‚ÄúStar Tours‚Äù in the 1980s? In what ways are these experiences similar to stories in more traditional media, and what challenges do they present to the idea of what is and isn‚Äôt ‚Äú[canon](https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/30/18645775/star-wars-land-disneyland-story-canon-galaxys-edge)‚Äù? What other stories would be well-suited to adaptation into immersive theme parks? Is there a reason these parks tend to favor fantasy and science fiction for their source material?
- Do writers have a responsibility [to finish the stories](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/george-r-r-martin-song-of-ice-and-fire-books-game-of-thrones-ending/589903/) they set out to tell‚Äîor is it up to them to decide whether they will ever publish a promised sequel or conclusion? When a series is canceled, do its producers owe fans some sort of closure on dangling story elements?
- Put on your creative hat. Which of the short stories and poems selected above would be best adapted into a film? Which one leaves you wanting a sequel?
- No one knows for sure who wrote it, but this [description of several major Western religions](https://innoculous.com/2016/08/explain-religions-abraham-hollywood-generation/)depends on audiences to understand the language of sequels. When did these terms and concepts become common enough that people could use them in jokes for the broader public? Could you apply the same terminology to political regimes, military campaigns, and product launches?
- These days, reboots of film franchises (like those of comic books) are generally accepted as normal; they happen all the time, and thus you have a lot of actors walking around who have played Spiderman. Why do you think existing novels are rarely (if ever) rebooted by new authors?
- Are prequels less likely to succeed than sequels? If so, why do people keep writing and producing them? Consider this [criticism](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/11/fantastic-beasts-reveals-j-k-rowling-has-the-same-problem-george-lucas-did-analysis-1202022503/) of the recent *Harry Potter* prequels; is the takeaway that prequels should be written by someone new?
- Is each World Scholar‚Äôs Cup season a sequel to the previous one? If so, what challenges does that present for its producers and for its participants? Could you imagine one designed as a prequel‚Äîor a sidequel?
